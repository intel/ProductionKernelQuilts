Subject: [PATCH 2/2] EM/mfd_pmic_core: Removing device name from the print in
 irq thread

Issue:
irq thread parses the irq based on the total number of irqs for
different subsystems in pmic (total of thermal, charger, adc, pwrsrc etc).
Multiple irqs are grouped together to their corresponding cell device.
For e.g, thermal might have all the irqs for systherms, pmic thermistor,
battery thermistor all grouped as resouces to the thermal cell device.
Cell devices and irqs have a 1:N mapping. Since, the total irqs always
out number the cell device count, the device name printing will cause
exception.

Solution:
Remove the device name from the pr_info statement and just print the irq
number. User can map the number to the device using cat /proc/interrupts
command in the shell and identify the source of wakeup.
