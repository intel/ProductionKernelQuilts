Subject: [PATCH 183/634] power: android-battery: leave full/not-charging
 status when charger re-sensed

If charger was connected and a charge source change event occurs such that
the charger is still connected (or a different charge source connected),
do not overwrite an existing state such as full or not-charging.  Only
switch from discharging to charging on a charge source change event.
